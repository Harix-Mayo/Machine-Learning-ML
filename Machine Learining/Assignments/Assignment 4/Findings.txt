Findings

In image compression by K-Mean K represents no. of colors in compressed image 

By increasing value of K processing time and size of compressed image also increases
but we can retrieve more information or detail of original image

In order to compress image by K-Mean we need an optimal value of K by which we could retrieve 
enough information or detail of original image while keeping size of compressed image minimum

we calculate that optimal value of k by Elbow Method
